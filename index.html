    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph about dogs. There are many dogs. Probably more than 20 or even 30 dogs. There are also many types of dogs. Some dogs are big and some are small. There are many facts about dogs that I could use to make this paragraph longer, however, dogs probably can't use google to look up facts so I wanted to replicate that style of typing in my project. 
      Below is an image of a dog. It is not the only dog out there, but it is an example of a dog that could be out there.

      Now this might have been an unfair picture to post because this dog is riding a skateboard. Most dogs do in fact not ride skateboards, this one just has a unique skill.
      Here is a better picture of a dog. This dog better represents all of dogs because it is not riding a skateboard, as most dogs will not ride skateboards.
